This is just an example which demonstrates how centrifuge-js browser build may be transpiled to `ES5` with Babel.

Clone repo, update `centrifuge.js` (get it [from CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/centrifuge) for example), then run:

```
npm i
npm run build
```

Output will be in `output/centrifuge.js`
